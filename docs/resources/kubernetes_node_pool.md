# thalassa_kubernetes_node_pool (Resource)

Create an Kubernetes Node Pool for a Kubernetes Cluster. This resource is only available for managed Kubernetes Clusters. A Node Pool is a group of nodes that are identically configured and are automatically joined to the Kubernetes Cluster. Node Pools can be scaled up and down as needed.

## Autoscaling Configuration

### When Autoscaling is Enabled (`enable_autoscaling = true`)
- **`replicas` must be unset** - The autoscaler manages the number of nodes
- **`min_replicas` is required** - Minimum number of nodes (must be â‰¥ 0)
- **`max_replicas` is required** - Maximum number of nodes
- **Current replicas are computed** - Shows the current number of nodes managed by the autoscaler

### When Autoscaling is Disabled (`enable_autoscaling = false`)
- **`replicas` is required** - Fixed number of nodes for the pool
- **`min_replicas` and `max_replicas` are ignored** - Not used in manual scaling mode

## Important Notes

- **Only available for managed clusters** - Not supported for hosted-control-plane clusters
- **`kubernetes_version` is optional** - If not specified, the cluster's version is used during initial creation of the node pool

## Schema

### Required

- `availability_zone` (String) Availability zone for the Kubernetes Node Pool
- `cluster_id` (String) Kubernetes Cluster of the Kubernetes Node Pool
- `machine_type` (String) Machine type for the Kubernetes Node Pool
- `name` (String) Name of the Kubernetes Node Pool
- `subnet_id` (String) Subnet ID where the Kubernetes node pool nodes will be deployed. This subnet must be in the same VPC as the Kubernetes cluster.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations for the Kubernetes Node Pool. Optional. These annotations are used for additional metadata and configuration. Annotations are not applied to the Kubernetes nodes created for this Node Pool, please use node_annotations instead.
- `description` (String) A human readable description about the Kubernetes Node Pool
- `enable_autohealing` (Boolean) Enable autohealing for the Kubernetes Node Pool
- `enable_autoscaling` (Boolean) Enable autoscaling for the Kubernetes Node Pool
- `kubernetes_version` (String) Kubernetes version for the node pool nodes. Optional - if not specified, the cluster's version will be used. Can be specified as version name, slug, or identity. Must be an enabled version.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels for the Kubernetes Node Pool. Optional. These labels are used for filtering and grouping resources in the Thalassa Console. Labels are not applied to the Kubernetes nodes created for this Node Pool, please use node_labels instead.
- `max_replicas` (Number) Maximum number of replicas for the Kubernetes Node Pool. May only be set when enable_autoscaling is true.
- `min_replicas` (Number) Minimum number of replicas for the Kubernetes Node Pool. May only be set when enable_autoscaling is true.
- `node_annotations` (Map of String) Annotations for the Kubernetes Nodes within this Node Pool. Optional. These annotations are applied to the Kubernetes nodes created for this Node Pool. Annotations must match the same constraints as Kubernetes annotations.
- `node_labels` (Map of String) Labels for the Kubernetes Nodes within this Node Pool. Optional. These labels are applied to the Kubernetes nodes created for this Node Pool. Labels must match the same constraints as Kubernetes labels.
- `node_taints` (Block List) Taints for the Kubernetes Node Pool (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--node_taints))
- `organisation_id` (String) Reference to the Organisation of the Kubernetes Node Pool. If not provided, the organisation of the (Terraform) provider will be used.
- `replicas` (Number) Number of replicas for the Kubernetes Node Pool. Do not set this when enable_autoscaling is true.
- `security_group_attachments` (List of String) List identities of security group that will be attached to the machines in the Node Pool
- `upgrade_strategy` (String) Upgrade strategy for the Kubernetes Node Pool

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `slug` (String) Slug of the Kubernetes Node Pool
- `status` (String) Status of the Kubernetes Node Pool

<a id="nestedblock--node_taints"></a>
### Nested Schema for `node_taints`

Optional:

- `effect` (String) Effect of the taint
- `key` (String) Key of the taint
- `operator` (String) Operator of the taint
- `value` (String) Value of the taint. Optional.
